Ninety per cent of the expansive property is protected by a conservation land trust and, as a result, the environment is vast and untamed. Only a few hundred dwellings sit within this stunning landscape, including The Meadow House by Mark English Architects – a large family home that elegantly fuses Korean and Californian design sensibilities.",
